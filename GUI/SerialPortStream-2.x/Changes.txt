Here is a list of some of the functional changes made in version 2.0.0.0

* General changes: Refactored to make the code much simpler to read and
  maintain, as well as to support for other platforms.

* DtrEnable no longer throws an exception on getting if the Handshake is set.
  Reading the property returns the value that would be set when handshaking
  for DTR/DSR is disabled.
* RtsEnable no longer throws an exception on getting if the Handshake is set.
  Reading the property returns the value that would be set when handshaking
  for RTS/CTS is disabled.



TODO:
* Clean up what methods check IsDisposed and not in SerialPortStream.
* If there is a problem with SetPortSettings, we should roll back somehow.
* WinNativeSerial doesn't need to set the DriverInQueue/DriverOutQueue as it
  can only be called when the port is not opened.
